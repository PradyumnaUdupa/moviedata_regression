# moviedata_regression
As a part of an Udemy course, on Python I did this project of data visualization and linear regression model on a dataset that contained information about movies budgets and revenue.The main aim was to see if there is a correlation between the budget and the world wide revenue.
I used matplotlib and seaborn for the data visualisation and plotting a linear regression chart.
Then used the linear regression model present in scikit-learn to run regressions and calculate coefficients.This can then be used to predict the world_wide revenue for a given movie budget.
